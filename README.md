# Switch-Config-Backup

This program will open an SSH connection to your Cisco switch and dump your running-config to a text file that is in a "Config Backups" folder on your profile desktop.  The only thing that is required is a switches.csv file in the folder that you're executing main.py from that is in the format of "name,ip"
